      <h3>The Hunters and The Hunt</h3>
<p>The hunters are a group of warriors who are dedicated to keeping their regions safe by hunting down beasts - or anything other than beasts if need be - that pose a threat. Hunters are agile fighters armed with a trick weapon, a transforming melee weapon in the right hand, and a firearm in the left. They do not employ shields, but rather take advantage of their mobility in order to avoid attacks. Hunters exist throughout the world and are not exclusive to Yharnam, since a number of characters such as the protagonist and Eileen come from the outside world and are yet still recognized as hunters. However, it is believed that the Hunters started out as a branch of the Healing Church very much like The Choir. This would mean that, at least in Yharnam, Hunters were recruited by either Gehrman or the Church itself.</p>

      <h3>The City of Yharnam</h3>
<p>Yharnam is a towering, labyrinthine gothic city, home to both the Healing Church and the Blood Ministrations. As no evidence of the existence of a ruling body is provided in the game, one may presume that the Healing Church controls the city (at least indirectly). The Church focuses around healing by infusions of blood. Miraculously, blood healing can repair wounds and cure or hinder diseases. Yharnam's whole culture became focused on blood, even to the point of blood-based drinks surpassing alcoholic beverages as the most commonly consumed. Yharnam's populace is apparently viewed as insane or degenerate by the wider world, and the citizens have become extremely distrustful of non-natives as a result.</p>

        <p>Bloodborne is a new IP developed by Sony & Fromsoftware, following gameplay elements from the acclaimed Demon's & Dark Souls series. Announced with emotional attachment by Shuhei Yoshida as a Playstation 4 exclusive at E3 2014, the game reunited Fromsoftware & Sony Japan studios with Hidetaka Miyazaki as the Director, and is said to have been in development since 2012's release of Dark Souls DLC Artorias of the Abyss.

The game is an Action RPG with focus on strategic combat choices, offering melee and ranged mechanics and replacing magic with gadgets and an arsenal of weapons. The game performs at 30fps/1080p, with character customization, online components and otherwise similar mechanics to that of the Souls series.</p>
